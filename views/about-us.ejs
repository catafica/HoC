	Cars are my passion! Since I was 5 years old I was obsessed with them, learning the names of all the cars I could get my eyes on. 
<br><br>
Then my parents introduced me to car magazinesâ€¦Oh my! Mix this with my love of businesses and entrepreneurship and here we are, starting House of Cars and trying to improve and become one of the top players on the Romanian car market.

With several years of experience in the auto remarketing industry, I decided to take things to another level: House of Cars Dealer SRL. The aim is to advance another operational methodology onto the European market, in which the client receives all relevant information, through which transparency is an uncompromising principle, all while giving the client control, from choice to delivery. Principles are our creed at House of Cars. Difficult or uncertain, pretentious or with limited budget, we can work together to find a solution for everyone.
